  description: >-
    ## Introduction


    The Griffin API is based on
    [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).

    It has resource-oriented URLs, accepts
    [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)-encoded request bodies, returns
    [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)-encoded responses, and uses
    standard HTTP response verbs and response codes.


    Our API deviates from strict RESTful principles if it makes sense to do so,
    such as when we enforce tighter access controls around certain operations.

    For example, when closing a bank account: rather than send a PATCH request
    to the [bank account](http://docs.griffin.com) resource to update it's
    status to `"closed"`, we provide a dedicated account closure resource.


    Anyone can [create an account](https://app.griffin.com/register) with
    Griffin and try out out API in [sandbox mode](http://docs.griffin.com).


    New to Griffin? Check out our [getting started
    guide](http://docs.griffin.com).


    ## Navigation


    Our API is designed to be navigated programmatically. When you request any
    resource, you will find the URLs for related resources in the response body.


    The API is structured as a tree with your
    [organization](http://docs.griffin.com) at the top. Everything that you own
    will be a sub-resource of your organization.


    To bootstrap the navigation process, request the
    [index](http://docs.griffin.com) endpoint: the response will contain your
    `organization-url`.


    For a walkthrough, see our [getting started guide](http://docs.griffin.com).


    ## Pagination


    Our list APIs support pagination (e.g. [list bank
    accounts](http://docs.griffin.com) and [list
    payments](http://docs.griffin.com)).

    By default, a list API returns up to 25 results. If there are more results
    available, the response payload will include links to the previous/next
    pages.


    ### Change page size


    You can request a different number of results (between 1 and 200, inclusive)
    by using the `page[size]` query parameter:


    ```

    GET /v0/organizations/:id/bank/accounts?page[size]=100

    ```


    ### Navigating between pages


    List responses will include a `links` object with `prev` and `next`
    attributes, as shown below.

    Perform a GET request to the value of the attribute to fetch the
    previous/next page of results.


    ```

    {
      "accounts": [
        // ...
      ],
      "links": {
        "prev": "/v0/organizations/og.IG9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbi1pZA/bank/accounts?page[before]=djE6WxSPxfYUTnCU9XtWzj9gGA",
        "next": "/v0/organizations/og.IG9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbi1pZA/bank/accounts?page[after]=djE6aw79PXZySUOL16LD8HRJ3A"
      }
    }


    ```

    If there is no previous or next page available, the value of the attribute
    will be  null.


    Any other query parameters included in the initial request will also be
    included in the response payload's links.

    If you want to change parameters (see [filtering and
    sorting](http://docs.griffin.com)), request the first page and follow the
    links from there.


    ## Filtering and sorting


    ### Sort results


    By default, resources will be listed in descending order, usually based on
    the `created-at` attribute.

    You can change the sorting behaviour of a list of results by using the
    `sort` query parameter.


    For example, to list bank accounts in ascending order (oldest first):


    ```

    GET /v0/organizations/:id/bank/accounts?sort=created-at

    ```


    To _explicitly_ sort in descending order (newest first), prefix the sort
    attribute with `-`:


    ```

    GET /v0/organizations/:id/bank/accounts?sort=-created-at

    ```


    ### Filter results


    Some list APIs allow you to filter the results.

    Filters are expressed as nested data structures encoded into query
    parameters.

    For example, you can list bank accounts that are in either the `opening` or
    `open` state with:


    ```

    GET
    /v0/organizations/:id/bank/accounts?filter[account-status][in][]=opening&filter[account-status][in][]=open

    ```


    Similarly, you can list legal persons with a specific `application-status`:


    ```

    GET
    /v0/organizations/:id/legal-persons?filter[application-status][eq]=accepted

    ```


    ### Include resources


    Some list APIs allow you to include associated resources in the response,
    reducing the number of requests needed to fetch related data.

    For instance, when listing bank accounts, you can include each bank
    account's beneficiary legal person by using the `include` query parameter:


    ```

    GET /v0/organizations/:id/bank/accounts?include=beneficiary

    ```


    The response returns the usual list of bank accounts, but it will also have
    an `included` object with a `legal-persons` attribute:


    ```

    {
      "accounts": [
        // ...
      ],
      "links": {
        // ...
      }
      "included": {
        "legal-persons": [
          // ...
        ]
      }
    }

    ```


    Check the documentation for each list API to see all options for sorting and
    filtering


    ## Versioning


    The Griffin API is versioned via a prefix in the URL.

    The current version is v0.

    An example endpoint is: https://api.griffin.com/v0/index.


    We will not break your integration with a particular version for as long as
    we support that version.

    If we release a new version, you will have 12 months to upgrade to it.

      A payment captures the intent to move funds from a bank account to another
      party's bank account. Outbound payments can be made from your [bank
      account](http://docs.griffin.com) to a [payee](http://docs.griffin.com).
      Griffin accepts inbound payments to your bank accounts on your behalf. 
       If it's your first time using our payments API, check out our guide for [making a payment](http://docs.griffin.com)

      Bank accounts are used for managing funds. You can open different types of
      bank account using the `"bank-product-type"` field. Some account types are
      for managing your own funds and some are for managing your customers'
      funds. For information, check out our guides for opening bank accounts:
        - [open an operational account](http://docs.griffin.com).

      The `api-key-secret` field is only shown once when you create an API key.

      We cannot recover the value, so you should store it securely.


      Pass an `Authorization` header with `GriffinAPIKey api-key-secret` to
      authenticate.


      Each API key is only valid for one
      [organization](http://docs.griffin.com).

      If you are a [member](http://docs.griffin.com) of multiple organizations,
      you will need to create a new API key for each one.

      There is currently no limit on the number of API keys you can create.

  - description: >-
      In the Griffin API, your organization and your customers are all
      represented by [legal persons](http://docs.griffin.com). When you sign up
      with Griffin, your organization will be automatically assigned a unique
      legal person ID. When onboarding your customers, you will create legal
      persons to represent them.


      Every legal person has a `legal-person-type` with the value: `individual`
      or `corporation`.


      An `individual` represents an individual human.


      A `corporation` represents any non-human entity (not just companies). A
      corporation should have at least one [director](http://docs.griffin.com)
      or [person with significant control](http://docs.griffin.com) attached to
      it, who must also be represented as a distinct `individual` legal person.

      The transaction resource represents any form of activity in a bank account
      that results in a change to the account’s balance. Transactions can be
      categorised by their type (`balance-change-origin-type`). Here are some
      common types of bank transactions:
       1. **Payment**: Sending funds to, or receiving funds from, another bank account.
       2. **Fee**: Charges applied to the bank account by Griffin.
       3. **Interest**: An amount charged on borrowed money, or paid to the account holder on deposited funds.

      The organization resource represents your company and acts as a container
      for the majority of other resources, including [legal
      persons](http://docs.griffin.com) and [bank
      accounts](http://docs.griffin.com).

      When you register for an account with Griffin, a new
      [organization](http://docs.griffin.com) is created alongside your
      [user](http://docs.griffin.com) account (unless you have received an
      [invitation](http://docs.griffin.com) to join an existing organization).

      Your [user](http://docs.griffin.com) account is associated with an
      [organization](http://docs.griffin.com) via a
      [membership](http://docs.griffin.com).


      Your [organization](http://docs.griffin.com) can be in one of two modes:

      - `test-mode` for organizations created when you sign up for the sandbox.

      - `live-mode` for when you go live with Griffin.

      [organization](http://docs.griffin.com), and may have memberships in
      multiple organizations.

      Invitations enable [users](http://docs.griffin.com) to create new
      [memberships](http://docs.griffin.com) for their
      [organization](http://docs.griffin.com).

      The new membership is only created once when the invitation is accepted.


      If the `email-address` provided is linked to an existing user, the
      invitation will create a membership for that user.

      This does not affect any other memberships the user may have.


      If the `email-address` is not linked to an existing user, the invitee will
      be prompted to set up a Griffin account when they accept the invitation.


      When a new membership is created, the invited user is assigned the
      [role](http://docs.griffin.com) with the most limited set of capabilities
      by default.

      description: >-
        Initiates verification of the subject legal person.


        The request body must include a `workflow-url` to determine checks to be

        performed by the verification. The workflow specified determines which
        claims

        must exist for the subject legal person, as identified in the request
        URL, and any

        associated legal persons (i.e. directors and people with significant
        control of a

        corporation).


        These claims can be found in the `required-claim-types` field on a
        [Workflow](http://docs.griffin.com).


        ---


        Once a verification is created, the system will perform checks on the
        claim details.

        The status of check processing is indicated by the `verification-status`
        in the response body.

        Initially it will be `pending`, and will transition through
        `in-progress` to a final status of `checks-complete`.


        A `verification-status` of `failed` indicates something went wrong
        during check processing.

        You can initiate another verification to retry the check processing.

          The request body must include a `workflow-url` to determine checks to be performed by the verification.
          The workflow specified determines which claims must exist for the subject profile, and any related profile (i.e. directors and people with significant control of a corporation).

          ---

          At the moment we only support 3 reliance workflows: Reliance LTD Company, Reliance Individual and Reliance Sole Trader.

          You need to provide different claims depending on the type of customer you wish to onboard via reliance.
          | LTD Company | Individual | Sole trader |
          | ----------- | ---------- | ----------- |
          | Subject profile:<br>`uk-company-register`<br>`trading-address`<br>`reliance-verification`<br><br>Related profiles:<br>`individual-identity`<br>`individual-residence`<br>`reliance-verification` | Subject profile:<br>`individual-identity`<br>`individual-residence`<br>`reliance-verification` | Subject profile:<br>`business-name`<br>`individual-identity`<br>`individual-residence`<br>`reliance-verification` |
