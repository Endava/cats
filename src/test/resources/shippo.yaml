      Carriers are the companies who deliver your package. Shippo uses Carrier
      account objects as credentials to retrieve shipping rates and purchase
      labels from shipping Carriers.

      A batch is a technique for creating multiple labels at once. Use the 
      batch object to create and purchase many shipments in two API calls. After
      creating the batch, retrieve the batch to verify that all shipments are
      valid. You can add and remove shipments after you have created the batch.
      When all shipments are valid you can purchase the batch and retrieve all
      the shipping labels.

      # Batch Shipment

      The batch shipment object is a wrapper around a shipment object, which
      include shipment-specific information 

      for batch processing.


      Note: batch shipments can only be created on the batch endpoint, either
      when creating a batch object or by through 

      the `/batches/{BATCH_OBJECT_ID}/add_shipments` endpoint

      A user parcel template represents a package used for shipping that has
      preset dimensions and attributes defined 

      by you. They are useful for capturing attributes of parcel-types you
      frequently use for shipping, allowing 

      them to be defined once and then used for many shipments. These parcel
      templates can also be used for live rates.


      User parcel templates can also be created using a carrier parcel template,
      where the dimensions will be copied from 

      the carrier presets, but the weight can be configured by you.

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/UserParcelTemplate"/>

  - description: >-
      Addresses are the locations a parcel is being shipped **from** and **to**.
      They represent company and residential places. Among other things, you can
      use address objects to create shipments, calculate shipping rates, and
      purchase shipping labels.

      A service group is a set of service levels grouped together. 

      Rates at checkout uses services groups to present available shipping
      options to customers in their shopping basket.

      Rates at checkout is a tool for merchants to display up-to-date shipping
      estimates based on what's in their customers cart and where they’re
      shipping to.

      Merchants set up curated shipping options for customers in the checkout
      flow based on data in the shopping cart. The request must include the
      **to** address and item information. Optional fields are the **from**
      address and package information. If the optional fields are not included,
      the service will use the default address and/or package configured for
      rates at checkout. The response is a list of shipping options based on the
      Service Group configuration.

      (see <a href="#tag/Service-Groups">Service Group configuration</a> for
      details).

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/LiveRate"/>



      # Default Parcel Template

      Assign one of your user parcel templates to be the default used when
      generating Live Rates. This template will be used by default when
      generating Live Rates, unless you explicitly provide a parcel in the Live
      Rates request.

      Shippo Accounts are used by Shippo Platform Accounts to create and manage
      Managed Shippo Accounts. 

      Managed Shippo Accounts are headless accounts that represent your
      customers. They are opaque to your end customers, meaning customers do not
      need to create their own Shippo login or have a billing relationship with
      Shippo. 

      They can be used by marketplaces, e-commerce platforms, and third-party
      logistics providers who want to offer, seamless, built-in shipping
      functionality to their customers.

      A manifest is a single-page document with a barcode that carriers can scan
      to accept all packages into transit without the need to scan each item
      individually. 

      They are close-outs of shipping labels of a certain day. Some carriers
      require manifests to  process the shipments.

      # Manifest Errors

      The following codes and messages are the possible errors that may occur
      when creating Manifests.

      An order is a request from a customer to purchase goods from a merchant. 

      Use the orders object to load orders from your system to the Shippo
      dashboard.

      You can use the orders object to create, retrieve, list, and manage orders
      programmatically. 

      You can also retrieve shipping rates, purchase labels, and track shipments
      for each order.

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Order"/>


      # Line Item

      <p style="text-align: center; background-color: #F2F3F4;">
        </br>Line Items, and their corresponding abstract Products and Variants, might be exposed as a separate resource 
        in the future. Currently it's a nested object within the order resource.</br></br>
      </p>
       A line item is an individual object in an order. For example, if your order contains a t-shirt, shorts, and a jacket, each item is represented by a line item.

      If you purchased your shipping label through Shippo, you can also get all
      the tracking details of your Shipment 

      from the <a href="#tag/Transactions">Transaction</a> object.

      </br></br></p>

      A tracking status of a package is an indication of current location of a
      package in the supply chain. For example,  sorting, warehousing, or out
      for delivery. Use the tracking status object to track the location of your
      shipments.


      When using your <a
      href="https://docs.goshippo.com/docs/guides_general/authentication/">Test</a>
      token for tracking, you need to use Shippo's 

      predefined tokens for testing different tracking statuses. You can find
      more information in our 

      <a href="https://docs.goshippo.com/docs/tracking/tracking/">Tracking
      tutorial</a> on how to do this, and what the 

      payloads look like.

      A carrier parcel template represents a package used for shipping that has
      preset dimensions defined by a carrier. Some examples of a carrier parcel
      template include USPS Flat Rate Box and Fedex Small Pak. When using a
      carrier parcel template, the rates returned may be limited to the carrier
      that provides the box. You can create user parcel templates using a
      carrier parcel template. Shippo takes the dimensions of the carrier parcel
      template but you must configure the weight.

      <h3>API Resources</h3>

      All API URLs listed in this documentation are relative to
      <b>https://api.goshippo.com/</b>.


      For example, the `/addresses/` resource is reachable at
      `https://api.goshippo.com/addresses/`.



      <h3>Authentication</h3>

      The API requires Shippo's token HTTP Authentication with your Shippo token
      (live or test). 


      In order to authenticate properly, please put `Authorization: ShippoToken
      <token>` in your header. You can find your token on the 

      <a href="https://goshippo.com/user/apikeys/">Shippo API settings page</a>.




      For more information about authentication and test mode, 

      <a
      href="https://docs.goshippo.com/docs/guides_general/authentication/">please
      visit our Authentication guide</a>.


      The API is available via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) only. All requests to
      the Shippo API must use TLS version 1.2 or higher.


      <h3>Request & Response Data</h3>

      Request data is passed to the API by <b>POSTing JSON objects</b> with the
      appropriate key/value-pairs to the respective 

      resource. The documentation for each API resource contains more details on
      the values accepted by a given resource.


      Response data also formatted as JSON object. You can specify how many
      results per page are to be returned. For instance, 

      `/rates/?results=25` will return up to 25 results.


      <h3>REST & Disposable Objects</h3>

      The Shippo API is built around <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST
      principles</a>. 

      Use POST requests to create objects, GET requests to retrieve objects, and
      PUT requests to update objects.


      Only the Carrier Accounts object can be updated via PUT requests. All
      other objects such as Addresses, Parcels, 

      Shipments, Rates, Transactions, Refunds, Customs Items, and Customs
      Declarations are disposable. This means that 

      once you have created an object, you cannot change it. Instead, create a
      new one with the desired values.


      <h3>API Version</h3>


      This reference guide supports the Shippo API version: `2018-02-08` . 


      To see reference guides for older API versions, see our <a
      href="https://docs.goshippo.com/docs/guides_general/legacy_reference/">legacy
      reference guide</a>.

        the API response won't include your batch shipments yet. You need to

      summary: Retrieve shipment rates in currency
      operationId: Rates_getShipmentRatesInCurrency
      description: >-
        Returns all available shipping rates for a shipment object.


        When you create a new valid shipment object, Shippo automatically
        calculates all available rates. Depending on your shipment data, there
        may be none, one or multiple rates.


        By default, the calculated rates will return the price in two currencies
        under the `amount` and `amount_local` keys, respectively. The `amount`
        key will contain the price of a rate expressed in the currency that is
        used in the country from where the parcel originates, and the
        `amount_local` key will contain the price expressed in the currency that
        is used in the country the parcel is shipped to. You can request rates
        with prices expressed in a different currency by adding the currency
        code to the end of the resource URL. The full list of supported
        currencies along with their codes can be viewed on <a
        href="http://openexchangerates.org/api/currencies.json">open exchange
        rates</a>.


        Note: re-requesting the rates with a different currency code will
        re-queue the shipment (i.e. set the Shipment's `status` to `QUEUED`) and
        the converted currency rates will only be available when the Shipment's
        `status` is set to `SUCCESS`.

        parcel template using a preset carrier template as a starting point, or

        you can create an entirely custom one. To use a preset carrier template,

        pass in a unique template token from <a
        href="#tag/Parcel-Templates">this list</a>

        plus the weight fields (**weight** and **weight_unit**). Otherwise, omit

        the template field and pass the other fields, for the weight, length,
        height,

        and depth, as well as their units."
