| **Description**                                 | This fuzzer will send a request with an invalid JSON. The expectation is that APIs reject the request as invalid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

:::info
Please note that because the CATS report will only display valid JSON files for both request and responses, the final report won't display the malformed JSON which includes the `bla` string at the end.
No need to worry, as CATS is actually sending the right malformed data to the service. You can check the running logs for the line starting with `Final payload:` to see the exact string which is being send to the service.
