# Arguments
You can get the full list of arguments by running `cats -h`. Below is a short description for each:

- `--contract=LOCATION_OF_THE_CONTRACT` supplies the location of the OpenApi or Swagger contract.
- `--server=URL` supplies the URL of the service implementing the contract.
- `--basicauth=USR:PWD` supplies a `username:password` pair, in case the service uses basic auth.
- `--authRefreshInterval=value_in_seconds` Amount of time in seconds after which to get new auth credentials
- `--authRefreshScript=script` Script to get executed after `--authRefreshInterval` in order to get new auth credentials. The script will replace any headers that have `auth_script` as value. If you don't supply a `--authRefreshInterval`, but you supply a script, the script will be used to get the initial auth credentials.
- `--fuzzers=LIST_OF_FUZZERS` supplies a comma separated list of fuzzers. The supplied list of Fuzzers can be partial names, not full Fuzzer names. CATS which check for all Fuzzers containing the supplied strings. If the argument is not supplied, all fuzzers will be run.
- `--log=PACKAGE:LEVEL` can configure custom log level for a given package. You can provide a comma separated list of packages and levels or a level to apply to everything. This is helpful when you want to see full HTTP traffic: `--log=org.apache.http.wire:debug` or suppress CATS logging: `--log=com.endava.cats:warn`
- `--skipLog=LEVELS`  A list of log levels to skip. For example, you can skip only note and info levels, but leave the rest
- `--paths=PATH_LIST` supplies a comma separated list of OpenApi paths to be tested. If no path is supplied, all paths will be considered.
- `--skipPaths=PATH_LIST` a comma separated list of paths to ignore. If no path is supplied, no path will be ignored
- `--fieldsFuzzingStrategy=STRATEGY` specifies which strategy will be used for field fuzzing. Available strategies are `ONEBYONE`, `SIZE` and `POWERSET`. More information on field fuzzing can be found in the sections below.
- `--maxFieldsToRemove=INTEGER` specifies the maximum number of fields to be removed when using the `SIZE` fields fuzzing strategy.
- `--refData=FILE` specifies the file containing static reference data which must be fixed in order to have valid business requests. This is a YAML file. It is explained further in the sections below.
- `--headers=FILE` specifies a file containing headers that will be added when sending payloads to the endpoints. You can use this option to add oauth/JWT tokens for example.
- `--edgeSpacesStrategy=STRATEGY` specifies how to expect the server to behave when sending trailing and prefix spaces within fields. Possible values are `trimAndValidate` and `validateAndTrim`.
- `--sanitizationStrategy=STRATEGY` specifies how to expect the server to behave when sending Unicode Control Chars and Unicode Other Symbols within the fields. Possible values are `sanitizeAndValidate` and `validateAndSanitize`
- `--urlParams param1:value1 param2:value2` A comma separated list of 'name:value' pairs of parameters to be replaced inside the URLs. This is useful when you have static parameters in URLs (like 'version' for example).
- `--functionalFuzzerFile=FILE ` a file used by the `FunctionalFuzzer` that will be used to create user-supplied payloads.
- `--skipFuzzers=LIST_OF_FIZZERs` a comma separated list of fuzzers that will be skipped for **all** paths. You can either provide full `Fuzzer` names (for example: `--skippedFuzzers=VeryLargeStringsFuzzer`) or partial `Fuzzer` names (for example: `--skipFuzzers=VeryLarge`). `CATS` will check if the `Fuzzer` names contains the string you provide in the arguments value.
- `--skipFields=field1,field2#subField1` a comma separated list of fields that will be skipped by replacement Fuzzers like EmptyStringsInFields, NullValuesInFields, etc. **When a field starts with `!` any field that starts with that name will be entirely skipped for fuzzing**
- `--httpMethods=PUT,POST,etc` a comma separated list of HTTP methods that will be used to filter which http methods will be executed for each path within the contract
- `--securityFuzzerFile=FILE` A file used by the `SecurityFuzzer` that will be used to inject special strings in order to exploit possible vulnerabilities
- `--printExecutionStatistics` If supplied (no value needed), prints a summary of execution times for each endpoint and HTTP method. By default this will print a summary for each endpoint: max, min and average. If you want detailed reports you must supply `--printExecutionStatistics=detailed`
- `--timestampReports` If supplied (no value needed), it will output the report still inside the `cats-report` folder, but in a sub-folder with the current timestamp
- `--reportFormat=FORMAT` Specifies the format of the CATS report. Supported formats: `HTML_ONLY`, `HTML_JS` or `JUNIT`. You can use `HTML_ONLY` if you want the report to not contain any Javascript. This is useful in CI environments due to Javascript content security policies. Default is `HTML_JS` which includes some sorting and filtering capabilities.
- `--[no-]useExamples` If `true` then CATS will use ALL examples supplied in the OpenAPI contract. This is equivalent to setting `--usePropertyExamples --useRequestBodyExamples --useResponseBodyExamples --useSchemaExamples`. If `false` CATS will rely only on generated values

- `--errorLeaksKeywords=<errorLeaksKeywords>` A properties file with error leaks keywords that will be used when processing responses to detect potential error leaks. If one of these keyword is found, the test case will be marked as error

:::tip
When you want to skip fuzzing entirely for a specific JSON object or specific fields you must prefix the field name from the `--skipFields` argument with `!`.
The following `--skipFields="!address"` will skip fuzzing for all sub-fields of the `address` object. If you also want CATS to not sent the `address` 
object at all to the service (sometimes some object might not make sense in conjunction with other objects) you must also use the `cats_remove_field`
within the reference data file.

```yaml
all:
  address: cats_remove_field
```

:::

Next arguments are active only when supplying a custom dictionary via `--words`:
- `--matchResponseCodes=<matchResponseCodes>[,<matchResponseCodes>...]` A comma separated list of HTTP response codes that will be matched as error. All other response codes will be ignored from the final report. If provided, all Contract Fuzzers will be skipped
- `--matchResponseLines=<matchResponseLines>[,<matchResponseLines>...]` A comma separated list of number of line counts in the response that will be matched as error. All other response line counts will be ignored from the final report. If provided, all Contract Fuzzers will be skipped
- `--matchResponseRegex=<matchResponseRegex>` A regex that will match against the response that will be matched as error. All other response body matches will be ignored from the final report. If provided, all Contract Fuzzers will be skipped
- `--matchResponseSize=<matchResponseSizes>[,<matchResponseSizes>...]` A comma separated list of response sizes that will be matched as error. All other response sizes will be ignored from the final report. If provided, all Contract Fuzzers will be skipped
- `--matchResponseWords=<matchResponseWords>[,<matchResponseWords>...]` A comma separated list of word counts in the response that will be matched as error. All other response word counts will be ignored from the final report. If provided, all Contract Fuzzers will be skipped

```bash
cats --contract=my.yml --server=https://locathost:8080 --checkHeaders
```

This will run CATS against `http://localhost:8080` using `my.yml` as an API spec and will only run the HTTP headers Fuzzers.
